# üßπ Sonarr Queue Stuck Item Cleaner
#
# This script connects to the Sonarr API and checks the download queue for items that are
# stuck after a failed import. These are typically downloads that:
#   - Have `status: completed`
#   - Show `timeleft: 00:00:00` (fully downloaded)
#   - Have `trackedDownloadStatus: warning` OR `trackedDownloadState: importPending`
#   - Include a status message such as "No files found"
#
# Such items are likely completed downloads that Sonarr failed to import (e.g., missing or moved files).
# The script identifies these stuck queue items and automatically deletes them from the queue using:
#   DELETE /api/v3/queue/{id}
#
# ‚ö†Ô∏è Deletion is ENABLED by default. To disable it, comment out the deletion lines.
#
# Requirements:
#   - bash
#   - curl
#   - jq
#
# Usage:
#   - Configure SONARR_URL and API_KEY below
#   - Run manually: `bash clear_queue.sh`
#   - Run manually: `bash clear_queue.sh --dry-run` to perform a dry run
#   - Or schedule with cron to run automatically
